# pdfgoose

pdfgoose is a free and open source pdfviewer and pdfeditor. It is based on mozilla/pdf.js as the primary renderer for the documents.
The desktop application is an electron based web server application, with a core written in golang.
It is also possible to run the web server independently. So if you don't want to install the desktop application, pdfgoose can also run on a server.

## Installation

### desktop

```bash
echo "TODO"
```
### server

```bash
echo "TODO -> use docker for this"
```
